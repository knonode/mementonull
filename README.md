# Memento Mori World Population Simulator

## Overview
This is a world's first on-chain population simulator. Circulating supply is the current population number. Every hour newborn people minus deceased are added to circulating supply, following a curve based on United Nations Population Division data projections.

The reserve account is funded to run until year 2100 or until reaching total supply or in case fee structure changes on Algorand protocol.

## Concept
A philosophical discussion conceived as an Algorand ASA with a fluctuating circulating supply pegged to the amount of people living on planet Earth at present time.

The project, being built on Algorand and closely tied to the monetary system as such, asks questions about the worth of a human life. One $MEMO represents one living human, and in principle every human being on the planet and orbiting it, is accredited with one $MEMO.

## Important Note
This token will never be made available for trading and is made only for educational and entertainment purposes. It has freeze and clawback enabled to keep options for further development open.
